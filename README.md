A fine-tuned transformer model that classifies e-commerce product reviews as **Positive** or **Negative**, served through a Streamlit UI. Built with a modular, testable, production-style structure: config-driven training, a reusable inference layer, unit tests, CI, and Docker packaging.

> **Note:** the CI badge above assumes this repo is pushed to `Gayathri-Reddy874/ecommerce-sentiment-analysis` on GitHub. Update the badge URL and the clone URL below if you use a different repo name.

## Features

- **Transformer-based classifier** — fine-tunes a Hugging Face model (`distilbert-base-uncased` by default) on labeled review text using the `Trainer` API.
- **Config via environment variables** — swap the base model, hyperparameters, or model path without touching code (`.env.example` provided).
- **Shared inference layer** — a single `SentimentPredictor` class is used by the Streamlit app, the CLI, and the tests, so prediction logic lives in exactly one place.
- **Honest confidence reporting** — low-confidence predictions are flagged as uncertain rather than silently overridden by hand-written rules.
- **Unit tests + CI** — data cleaning and inference logic are covered by `pytest`, run automatically on every push via GitHub Actions.
- **Dockerized** — one command to build and run the app in a container.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gayathri-Reddy874/ecommerce-sentiment-analysis.git
cd ecommerce-sentiment-analysis
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 3. Configure (optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env to change model, epochs, batch size, etc.
```

### 4. Train the model

```bash
python -m src.train
# or override hyperparameters directly:
python -m src.train --epochs 3 --batch-size 8 --model distilbert-base-uncased
```

This trains on `data/raw/ecommerce_reviews.csv`, evaluates each epoch (accuracy, precision, recall, F1), and saves the best checkpoint to `models/sentiment_model/`.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

### 6. Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
```

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`. The `models/` directory is mounted as a volume, so train locally first (or mount a pre-trained model) — the container itself doesn't bundle model weights.

## How Labels Are Derived

Reviews don't come with a sentiment label directly, so one is derived from the star rating:

| Rating | Label      |
|--------|------------|
| 4–5    | Positive (1) |
| 1–2    | Negative (0) |
| 3      | Dropped (ambiguous/neutral) |

## Dataset Notes

`data/raw/ecommerce_reviews.csv` (997 rows) is real Amazon product review data (product ID, star rating, free-text review), not the earlier synthetic/templated sample. After cleaning, 903 rows remain across 4 unique products worth of review text with genuine variety.

One real-world characteristic worth knowing about: ratings skew positive (about 85% of the cleaned rows are 4–5 stars), which is typical of organic review data. To stop the model from just learning to always predict "positive," `src/train.py` computes class weights from the training split and applies them via a weighted cross-entropy loss (`WeightedTrainer` in `train.py`), so the minority (negative) class isn't drowned out during training.

If you swap in your own dataset, keep the same `review_id`, `product`, `rating`, `review_text` columns — no other code changes are required. If the dataset you use is still overwhelmingly one class even after weighting, consider also collecting more negative examples rather than relying on weighting alone.

## Design Decisions

- **No keyword-matching fallback.** An earlier prototype of this app second-guessed low-confidence model predictions with a hardcoded keyword list. That's removed: the model's prediction is always shown, along with its actual confidence, so it's clear when a result should be treated with caution.
- **`AutoTokenizer` / `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`** instead of BERT-specific classes, so the base model can be swapped via config without code changes.
- **Stratified train/val split** to preserve class balance.
- **Early stopping** on validation F1 to avoid overfitting on a small dataset.
